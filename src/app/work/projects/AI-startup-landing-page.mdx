## Technologies Used

- Framer Motion: For rich animation effects and polished transitions.

- Framer Template: Provided a clean, modern starting point for layout and UX.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing a dark-themed site that balances visual appeal with clarity was a key challenge. Special attention was given to contrast, button states, and content hierarchy. Also learned to integrate subtle animations that feel dynamic but not distracting.

## Outcome

The AI startup landing page effectively showcases the product's value with a bold, clean design and interactive feel. It delivers strong first impressions and is now used as a model for future brand sites and landing pages within the startup ecosystem.
