## Overview

Built a modern SaaS landing page using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, featuring an interactive draggable hero section. The focus was on creating a highly engaging first impression with smooth animations and a unique interaction pattern that sets the brand apart.

## Key Features

Draggable Hero Section: Designed an interactive hero element with drag-to-explore functionality, providing an immersive and playful user experience right from the start.

- Framer Motion Animations: Integrated dynamic entrance animations and smooth transitions across the page to enhance engagement and visual polish.

- Modern Aesthetic: Focused on a clean, minimal design with strategic use of color and spacing to highlight key messaging.

- Responsive & Accessible: Ensured the layout works seamlessly across devices with attention to accessibility and performance optimization.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: For fast, SEO-friendly rendering and easy routing.

- Tailwind CSS: To build utility-based, responsive UI components quickly.

- Framer Motion: For animations and interactive drag behavior in the hero section.

- React: To handle interactive state and smooth component behavior throughout.

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing drag interactions in a hero section required fine-tuning motion boundaries, responsiveness, and touch support. Learned how to blend animation logic with layout design without overwhelming the user experience.

## Outcome

The resulting landing page delivers a bold and interactive experience that immediately captures attention. The draggable hero section became a standout feature, increasing engagement and setting the tone for a modern SaaS brand.
